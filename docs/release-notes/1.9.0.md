## New Features

- During the Istio upgrade, Pods with the Istio sidecar proxies will now be divided into smaller groups and restarted in multiple reconciliations instead of all at once. This will increase the stability and reliability of the reconciliation for the Istio module's operator. See the [issue #155](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/155).
- Update the Istio version to 1.22.3 [#945](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/945). Read [Istio 1.22.3 Release Announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.22.x/announcing-1.22.3/).

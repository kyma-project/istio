## New Features

- During the Istio upgrade, Pods with the Istio sidecar proxies will now be divided into smaller groups and restarted in multiple reconciliations instead of all at once. This will increase the stability and reliability of the reconciliation for the Istio module's operator. See the [issue #155](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/155).
- We've updated the Istio version to 1.23.2 ([#1024](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1024)). Read Istio 1.23.2 [Release Announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.23.x/announcing-1.23.2/) and Istio 1.23.0 [Change Notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.23.x/announcing-1.23/change-notes/). 
Take note of the following breaking chnges included in the new minor version of Istio:
  - An experimental feature to enable cluster creation on worker threads inline during requests. This saves memory and CPU cycles in cases where there are lots of inactive clusters and more than one worker thread.
  - Previously, the Envoy cluster metrics for services that did not have a `.svc.cluster.local` suffix
    were incorrectly truncated and parsed. This was due to the fact that Envoy cluster metrics use dots "." as
    a delimeter between metric namespaces, and it is impossible to properly distinguish between those
    delimeters and the dots in hostnames/cluster names. To address this, the regex for parsing the cluster_name
    has been updated to look for a semicolon to indicate the end of the cluster name. If you're using
    the `inbound_cluster_stat_name` or `outbound_cluster_stat_name` fields in meshconfig, the semicolon
    will be added automatically for you. If you have any dependency on the full stat name for cluster metrics,
    you will need to update your monitoring system to account for this change.


  If any of these changes are causing disruption to your applications and you require more time to make adjustments, consider enabling compatibility version of Istio 1.22. It reverts the new bahavior by applying the `ENABLE_DELIMITED_STATS_TAG_REGEX` and `ENABLE_DEFERRED_CLUSTER_CREATION` enavironment variables. See [Compatibility Version](https://kyma-project.io/#/istio/user/00-10-overview-istio-controller?id=compatibility-mode).

# Ingress and Egress traffic

## Ingress

[Istio Ingress Gateway](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/) handles all incoming traffic, manages TLS termination, and facilitates mTLS communication between the cluster and external services. By default, the [`kyma-gateway`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/main/resources/istio-resources/templates/gateway.yaml) configuration defines the points of entry to expose all applications using the supplied domain and certificates.

The configuration specifies the following parameters and their values:

| Parameter | Description | Value|
|-----| ---| -----|
| **spec.servers.port** | The ports gateway listens on.  Port `80` is automatically redirected to `443`.| `443`, `80`.|
| **spec.servers.tls.minProtocolVersion** | The minimum protocol version required by the TLS connection. | `TLSV1_2` protocol version. `TLSV1_0` and `TLSV1_1` are rejected. |
| **spec.servers.tls.cipherSuites** | Accepted cypher suites. | `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA`|

## TLS management

Kyma employs the Bring Your Own Domain/Certificates model that requires you to supply the domain, certificate, and key during installation. Read the tutorial to learn how to [set up or update your custom domain TLS certificate in Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/03-tutorials/00-security/sec-01-tls-certificates-security/).

If you don't want to use your custom certificate, you can choose between a self-signed certificate or one managed by the Gardener [Certificate Management](https://github.com/gardener/cert-management) component.

## Egress

Currently no Egress limitations are implemented, meaning that all applications deployed in the Kyma cluster can access outside resources without limitations.

>**NOTE:** In the case of connection problems with external services, it may be required to create a [Service Entry](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/service-entry/) object to register the service.

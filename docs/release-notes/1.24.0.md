## New Features

- Istio controller image is now running in FIPS140 compliancy mode, which is controlled by the `fips140=only,tlsmlkem=0` GODEBUG flags.
  We simplified the Istio installation, so it doesn't use port forwarding to get the Istio version.
  It also doesn't print the message about the Istio downgrade.
  See [#1672](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1672).
- Add support for the **SKR_IMG_PULL_SECRET** environment variable, which allows pulling Istio images from a secure registry.
  See [#1702](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1702).
- We've added dual-stack experimental support.
  See [#1700](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1700).
- We've added ambient mode experimental support.
  See [#1710](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1710).
- We've added support for **forwardClientCertDetails**.

- We've added support for Istio trust domain configuration.
  See [#1705](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1705)

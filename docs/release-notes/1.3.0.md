## New features

- Introduce conditions to Istio CR status [#468](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/468). Read [Istio Controller Overview](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/blob/main/docs/user/00-10-overview-istio-controller.md) for more details

- The Istio trace settings are now harmonized with the trace feature of the telemetry module and the semantic conventions of OpenTelemetry by having an improved `service.name` value attached to every span emitted by the Istio proxy.
  The service name determination now follows the same conventions as used in the telemetry module by first leveraging the `kubernetes.io/name` label. If not available, the `app` label is tried to be leveraged and then a fallback to the deployment name will happen.
  Also, the namespace suffix is not attached anymore to the service name to be aligned and also follow the OpenTelemetry conventions.
  Also, the Istio tracer is changed from the deprecated OpenCensus tracer to OpenTelemetry. As a side-effect the istio span name got improved by having the name prefixed with the operation name.
  A name like `example.com" is now called `ingress example.com`. PR [#508](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/508). Read [Switch Istio Tracing to OTLP and align Istio service name](https://github.com/kyma-project/telemetry-manager/issues/557) for more details.

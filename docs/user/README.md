# Istio Module

## What Is Istio?

Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a uniform way to manage, connect, and secure microservices. It helps to manage traffic, enhance security capabilities, and provide telemetry data for understanding service behavior. Read the [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/) to learn more.

## Kyma Istio Operator

Kyma Istio Operator is an essential part of the Istio module that handles the management and configuration of the Istio service mesh. It contains [Istio Controller](./00-10-overview-istio-controller.md) that is responsible for installing, uninstalling, and upgrading Istio.

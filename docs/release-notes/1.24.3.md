## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed how the default value for **forwardClientCertDetails** is handled in the Istio custom resource.
  Now, the field is not set by default, while the effective behavior remains the same as before (`SANITIZE_SET`).
  See [#1769](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1769).

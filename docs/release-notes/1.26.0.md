## Istio Updated to Version 1.28.3

We've updated the Istio version to 1.28.3 ([#1853](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1853)). See [Announcing Istio 1.28.3](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.28.x/announcing-1.28.3/).

## New Features
- Now, you can enable the global DNS proxying setting. When enabled, DNS requests from application Pods are intercepted by Istio proxies instead of being sent directly to upstream DNS servers. See [#1692](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1692).


## Enhancements

- We've added environment variables, which configure separate Istio FIPS images. See [#1843](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1843).
- [Experimental] Dual-stack support is now enabled when the `kyma-provisioning-info` ConfigMap is present and contains the **details.networkDetails.dualStackIPEnabled** field set to `true`. The field **spec.experimental.enableDualStack** is removed from the Istio CR in favor of the new approach. See: [#1871](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1871).

## Fixed Bugs
 - We've fixed the reconciliation failure that occurred when Istio-injected images contained SHA256 digest suffixes (e.g., image:1.28.2@sha256:abc123...). 
   The module now correctly handles images with digests, registries with ports, and all standard OCI image formats.
   See [#1817](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1817).
 - We've fixed an issue where, in certain cluster configurations, the Istio operator was cumulating istio-ingressgateway restart predicates. See [#1865](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1865).
 - We've fixed an issue in the reconciliation loop that caused unnecessary restarts of `istio-ingressgateway` and workloads with sidecars. See [#1875](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1875).
 - We've fixed double reconciliation triggered by **spec** updates in the Istio CR. This fix eliminates unnecessary second full installations, reduces cluster load, and prevents doubled ingress Gateway restarts. See [#1883](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1883).

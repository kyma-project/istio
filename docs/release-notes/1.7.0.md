## New Features

- Allow for opting out of the **ENABLE_EXTERNAL_NAME_ALIAS** Istio pilot environment variable in the Istio custom resource. This allows for retaining behavior that was present in Istio prior to version 1.21. See issue [#787](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/787 ).
- Update the Istio version to 1.21.2 [#802](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/802). Read [Istio 1.21.2 Release Announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21.2/) and [Change Notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21/change-notes/) for more details.

## New Features

- We've introduced support for the **timeout** and **pathPrefix** fields in the Istio custom resource external authorizer configuration.
This allows you to customize the timeout duration and path prefix for requests secured by the external authorizer. See [#1658](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1658).

## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed a bug that caused restarts during each reconciliation of an 
Istio-injected Pod with custom proxy resource settings defined using annotations.
See [#1649](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1649).

- We've fixed a bug where the `IstioVersion` annotation was not updated in the Istio CR when reconciliation failed to reach the last step, which could lead to blocked Istio upgrades. See [#1644](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1644).

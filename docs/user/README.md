# Istio Module

## What Is Istio?

Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a uniform way to manage, connect, and secure microservices. It helps to manage traffic, enhance security capabilities, and provide telemetry data for understanding service behavior. To learn more, read the [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/).

## Kyma Istio Operator

Kyma Istio Operator is an essential part of the Istio module that handles the management and configuration of the Istio service mesh. It contains [Istio Controller](./00-10-overview-istio-controller.md) that is responsible for installing, uninstalling, and upgrading Istio.

The latest release includes the following versions of Istio and Envoy:  

**Istio version:** 1.22.3

**Envoy version:** 1.30.5

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to enable compatibility with the previous minor version of Istio, see [Compatibility Mode](https://kyma-project.io/#/istio/user/00-10-overview-istio-controller?id=compatibility-mode).

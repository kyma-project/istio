Feature: X-Forwarded-For header

  Background:
    Given "Istio CR" is not present on cluster
    And Istio CRD is installed
    And Namespace "istio-system" is "not present"
    And "Deployment" "istio-controller-manager" in namespace "kyma-system" is ready

  Scenario: X-Forward-For header contains public client IP
    Given Istio CR "istio-sample" from "istio_cr_template" is applied in namespace "kyma-system"
    And Istio CR "istio-sample" in namespace "kyma-system" has status "Ready"
    And Istio injection is "enabled" in namespace "default"
    And Httpbin application "httpbin" deployment is created in namespace "default"
    And "Deployment" "httpbin" in namespace "default" is ready
    And Istio gateway "test-gateway" is configured in namespace "default"
    When Virtual service "test-vs" exposing service "httpbin.default.svc.cluster.local" by gateway "default/test-gateway" is configured in namespace "default"
    Then Request sent to exposed httpbin, should contain public client IP in "X-Forwarded-For" header

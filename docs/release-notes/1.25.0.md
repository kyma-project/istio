## Istio Updated to Version 1.28.2

We've updated the Istio version to 1.28.2 ([#1729](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1729)). See [Announcing Istio 1.28.2](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.28.x/announcing-1.28.2/).

## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed the incorrectly set default value for **forwardClientCertDetails** in the Istio custom resource.
  The default value is now `SANITIZE_SET` instead of `SANITIZE`.
  See [#1760](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1760).
- We've fixed how the default value for **forwardClientCertDetails** is handled in the Istio custom resource.
  Now, the field is not set by default, while the effective behavior remains the same as before (`SANITIZE_SET`).
  See [#1769](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1769).

## New features

- We introduced support for the timeout and pathPrefix fields in the Istio CustomResource external authorizer configuration.
This allows you to customize the timeout duration and path prefix for requests secured by the external authorizer. See [#1658](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1658).

## Fixed bugs

- We've fixed a bug that caused restarts during each reconciliation of an 
Istio-injected Pod with custom proxy resource settings defined using annotations.
See [#1649](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1649).

- We've fixed a bug where the `IstioVersion` annotation was not updated in the Istio CR when reconciliation failed to reach the last step, which could lead to blocked Istio upgrades. See [#1644](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1644).

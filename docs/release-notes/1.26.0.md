## Istio Updated to Version 1.28.3

We've updated the Istio version to 1.28.3 ([#1853](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1853)). See [Announcing Istio 1.28.3](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.28.x/announcing-1.28.3/).

## Enhancements

- We've added environment variables, which configure separate Istio FIPS images. See [#1843](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1843).

## Fixed Bugs
 - We've fixed the reconciliation failure that occurred when Istio-injected images contained SHA256 digest suffixes (e.g., image:1.28.2@sha256:abc123...). 
   The module now correctly handles images with digests, registries with ports, and all standard OCI image formats.
   See [#1817](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1817).
 - We've fixed an issue where, in certain cluster configurations, the Istio operator was cumulating istio-ingressgateway restart predicates. See [#1865](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1865).

## New features

- We introduced support for the timeout and pathPrefix fields in the Istio CustomResource external authorizer configuration.
This allows you to customize the timeout duration and path prefix for requests secured by the external authorizer. See [#1658](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1658).

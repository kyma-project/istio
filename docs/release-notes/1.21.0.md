## Istio Updated to Version 1.27.0

We've updated the Istio version to 1.27.0 ([#1578](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1578)).
Read the [Istio 1.27.0 release announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.27.x/announcing-1.27/) as well as [Upgrade Notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.27.x/announcing-1.27/upgrade-notes/) to learn about the new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes in this release.

> [!Warning]
> Istio since version 1.27.0 injects the Istio proxy as an initContainer by default. In this release, the operator disables this behavior to maintain compatibility. Please note that this disablement is temporary and will be removed in future releases, after which proxies will be injected as initContainers by default.

## New Features

- The Istio module now supports installation with Istio images injected into the installer from environment variables. This allows for more flexible deployments, especially in environments where images are not available in a public registry. See [issue #1519](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1519).

## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed a bug where the `proxy-protocol` EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the `Warning` state. See [#1491](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1491).
- We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled. See [#1523](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1523).
- We've fixed a bug where the `app.kubernetes.io/version` label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources. See [#1523](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1523).
- We've fixed a bug where Istio sidecar injected as initContainer was not removed during Istio uninstallation. See [#1555](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1555).

## Golden config for golangci-lint v1.49.0
#
# This is the best config for golangci-lint based on my experience and opinion.
# It is very strict, but not extremely strict.
# Feel free to adopt and change it for your needs.

# This file contains only configs which differ from defaults.
# All possible options can be found here https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/master/.golangci.reference.yml

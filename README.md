## Overview

Istio Manager is a module compatible with Lifecycle Manager that allows you to add Kyma Istio Operator to the Kyma ecosystem.

See also:

- [lifecycle-manager documentation](https://github.com/kyma-project/lifecycle-manager)
- [Istio documentation](https://https://istio.io/latest/)

## Prerequisites

- Access to a k8s cluster
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)

```bash
# you could use one of the following options

# option 1: using brew
brew install kubebuilder

# option 2: fetch sources directly
curl -L -o kubebuilder https://go.kubebuilder.io/dl/latest/$(go env GOOS)/$(go env GOARCH)
chmod +x kubebuilder && mv kubebuilder /usr/local/bin/
```

## Manual `istio-operator` installation

1. Clone project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyma-project/istio.git && cd istio/operator
```

2. Set `istio-operator` image name

```bash
export IMG=istio-operator:0.0.1
export K3D_CLUSTER_NAME=kyma
```

3. Provision k3d cluster with `kyma provision k3d`

4. Build project

```bash
make build
```

5. Build image

```bash
make docker-build
```

6. Push image to registry

<div tabs name="Push image" group="istio-operator-installation">
  <details>
  <summary label="k3d">
  k3d
  </summary>

   ```bash
   k3d image import $IMG -c $K3D_CLUSTER_NAME
   ```

  </details>
  <details>
  <summary label="Docker registry">
  Globally available Docker registry
  </summary>

   ```bash
   make docker-push
   ```

  </details>
</div>

7. Deploy

```bash
make deploy
```

## Using `istio-operator`

- Install Istio on cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/operator_v1alpha1_istio.yaml
```

- Delete Istio from cluster

```bash
kubectl delete -f config/samples/operator_v1alpha1_istio.yaml
```

## Installation in modular Kyma on the local k3d cluster

1. Setup local k3d cluster and local Docker registry

```bash
k3d cluster create kyma --registry-create registry.localhost:0.0.0.0:5001
```

2. Add the `etc/hosts` entry to register the local Docker registry under the `registry.localhost` name

```bash
127.0.0.1 registry.localhost
```

3. Export environment variables (ENVs) pointing to module and the module image registries

```bash
export IMG_REGISTRY=registry.localhost:5001/unsigned/operator-images
export MODULE_REGISTRY=registry.localhost:5001/unsigned
```

4. Build Istio module

```bash
make module-build
```

This builds an OCI image for Istio module and pushes it to the registry and path, as defined in `MODULE_REGISTRY`.

5. Build Istio manager image

```bash
make module-image
```

This builds a Docker image for Istio Manager and pushes it to the registry and path, as defined in `IMG_REGISTRY`.

6. Verify if the module and the manager's image are pushed to the local registry

```bash
curl registry.localhost:5001/v2/_catalog
```

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        "unsigned/component-descriptors/kyma.project.io/module/istio",
        "unsigned/operator-images/istio-operator"
    ]
}
```

7. Inspect the generated module template

The following are temporary workarounds.

Edit the `template.yaml` file and:

- change `target` to `control-plane`

```yaml
spec:
  target: control-plane
```

>**NOTE:** This is only required in the single cluster mode

- change the existing repository context in `spec.descriptor.component`:

>**NOTE:** Because Pods inside the k3d cluster use the docker-internal port of the registry, it tries to resolve the registry against port 5000 instead of 5001. K3d has registry aliases but module-manager is not part of k3d and thus does not know how to properly alias `registry.localhost:5001`

```yaml
repositoryContexts:                                                                           
- baseUrl: registry.localhost:5000/unsigned                                                   
  componentNameMapping: urlPath                                                               
  type: ociRegistry
```

>**NOTE** The `"operator.kyma-project.io/use-local-template": "true"` needs to be applied to make sure that Lifecycle Manager will use the registry URL present in ModuleTemplate

## Install modular Kyma on the k3d cluster

1. Install the latest version `lifecycle-manager` with `kyma alpha deploy`

```bash
- Kustomize ready
- Lifecycle Manager deployed
- Module Manager deployed
- Modules deployed
- Kyma CR deployed
- Kyma deployed successfully!

Kyma is installed in version:
Kyma installation took: 18 seconds

Happy Kyma-ing! :)
```

Kyma installation is ready, but no module is activated yet

```bash
kubectl get kymas.operator.kyma-project.io -A
NAMESPACE    NAME           STATE   AGE
kcp-system   default-kyma   Ready   71s
```

2. Apply `template.yaml` to register Istio as a module known for `lifecycle-manager`

Istio Module is a known module, but not activated

```bash
kubectl get moduletemplates.operator.kyma-project.io -A 
NAMESPACE    NAME                  AGE
kcp-system   moduletemplate-istio   2m24s
```

3. Give Lifecycle Manager permission to install CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) cluster-wide

>**NOTE:** This is a temporary workaround and is only required in the single-cluster mode

Module-manager must be able to apply CRDs to install modules. In the remote mode (with control-plane managing remote clusters) it gets an administrative kubeconfig, targeting the remote cluster to do so. But in local mode (single-cluster mode), it uses Service Account and does not have permission to create CRDs by default.

Run the following to make sure the module manager's Service Account becomes an administrative role:

```bash
kubectl edit clusterrole lifecycle-manager-manager-role
```

add

```yaml
- apiGroups:                                                                                                                  
  - "*"                                                                                                                       
  resources:                                                                                                               
  - "*"                                                                                                                       
  verbs:                                                                                                                      
  - "*"
```

4. Enable Istio in Kyma

```bash
kyma alpha enable module istio
```

## Installation with artifacts built for the `main` branch of Istio repository

You can install Istio module using the artificats that are created by `post-istio-module-build` job. To do so follow this steps:

1. Install `lifecycle-manager` on target cluster with `kyma alpha deploy`
2. Deploy the ModuleTemplate generated by the job (it is present in the job artifacts)
3. Install Istio module with `kyma alpha enable module istio -c alpha`

## Istio controller

### Controller overview

The Istio controller is part of Istio-Manager and manages the Istio installation defined by the Istio custom resource.
The controller takes care of installing, updating, and uninstalling Istio.

### Istio version

The version of Istio is coupled with the version of the controller. That means that the Istio upgrade is triggered by deploying a
new version of the controller.

### Istio custom resource

The `istios.operator.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) describes the Istio custom resource that is used
to manage the Istio installation. You can find a sample custom resource [here](config/samples/operator_v1alpha1_istio.yaml).  
Applying this custom resource triggers the installation of Istio, and deleting it triggers the uninstallation of Istio.

### Supported use cases

- Install, upgrade, and uninstall Istio.
- Restart workloads that have a proxy sidecar to ensure that these workloads are using the correct Istio version.

### Status codes

|   Code         | Description                                  |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------|
|  `Ready`       | Controller finished reconciliation.          |
|  `Processing`  | Controller is installing or upgrading Istio. |
|  `Deleting`    | Controller is uninstalling Istio.            |
|  `Error`       | An error occurred during reconciliation.     |

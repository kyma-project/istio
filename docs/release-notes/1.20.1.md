## Istio Updated to Version 1.26.2

We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2 ([#1503](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1503)).
Read the [Istio 1.26.2 release announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26.2/) as well
as [Istio 1.26.0 release announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/).

## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed a bug where the `proxy-protocol` EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the `Warning` state. See [#1491](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1491).

After much anticipation, numerous test releases, and an immense amount of hard work, we proudly announce the first production release 1.0 of the Istio module. This module will now be added to the collection of other modules that have already been separated from the classic Kyma as part of the [modularization process](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/blob/main/docs/contributor/01-00-installation.md). 
The Istio module offers similar functionality to the Istio reconciler. To better understand its capabilities, read the [documentation](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/tree/main/docs/user). And now, the time has come for you to [install the Istio module](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/blob/main/docs/contributor/01-00-installation.md) and share your feedback with us!

## New Features

- Allow for opting out of the **ENABLE_EXTERNAL_NAME_ALIAS** Istio pilot environment variable in the Istio custom resource. This allows for retaining behavior that was present in Istio prior to version 1.21. See issue [#787](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/787 ).
- Update the Istio version to 1.21.2 [#802](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/802). Read [Istio 1.21.2 Release Announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21.2/) and [Change Notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21/change-notes/) for more details.
- Add Request Authentication UI for Kyma dashboard [#816](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/816)
- Now, Istio Operator does not restart Pods with Istio Sidecar, which contain custom image annotations. See the issue [#698](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/698) and [Istio Resource Annotations](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/annotations/#SidecarProxyImage) for more details.

## New features

- Introduce conditions to Istio CR status [#468](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/468). Read [Istio Controller Overview](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/blob/main/docs/user/00-10-overview-istio-controller.md) for more details

- To ensure consistency between the Istio trace settings, the Telemetry module's trace feature, and OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions, we have decided to improve the `service.name` value which is attached to every span emitted by the Istio proxy.
  To determine the service name, the Istio module now follows the same conventions as the Telemetry module. First, it tries to leverage the `kubernetes.io/name` label. If not available, it checks for the `app` label. If neither label is present, it falls back to using the Deployment's name.
  Additionally, the namespace suffix is not attached anymore to the service name, which aligns with the conventions of OpenTelemetry.
   We have also changed the Istio tracer from the deprecated OpenCensus tracer to OpenTelemetry. This update has resulted in an improvement to the Istio span name, which is now prefixed with the operation name. For example, a name like `example.com` is changed to `ingress example.com`.
   To learn more, see the [PR #508](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/508) and read [Switch Istio Tracing to OTLP and align Istio service name](https://github.com/kyma-project/telemetry-manager/issues/557).

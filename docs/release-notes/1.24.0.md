## New Features

- Istio controller image is now FIPS compliant, which is enforced by `fips140=only,tlsmlkem=0` flags.
  We simplified the Istio installation, so it doesn't use port forwarding to get the Istio version.
  It also doesn't print the confusing message anymore about the Istio downgrade.
  See [#1672](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1672).

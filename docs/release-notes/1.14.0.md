## New Features

- Restarting sidecars is now divided into two phases. In the first phase, only Kyma workloads are restarted. If this phase fails, the Istio Custom Resource (CR) is set to the `Error` state. In the second phase, customer workloads are restarted in chunks. If any iteration of this phase fails, the Istio CR is set to the `Warning` state.

## Fixed Bugs
 - We've fixed the reconciliation failure that occurred when Istio-injected images contained SHA256 digest suffixes (e.g., image:1.28.2@sha256:abc123...). 
   The module now correctly handles images with digests, registries with ports, and all standard OCI image formats.
   See [#1817](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1817).

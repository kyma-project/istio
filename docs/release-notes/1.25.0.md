## Istio Updated to Version 1.27.4

We've updated the Istio version to 1.27.4 ([#1757](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1757)). See [Announcing Istio 1.27.4](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.27.x/announcing-1.27.4/).

## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed the incorrectly set default value for **forwardClientCertDetails** in the Istio custom resource.
  The default value is now `SANITIZE_SET` instead of `SANITIZE`.
  See [#1760](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1760).
- We've fixed how the default value for **forwardClientCertDetails** is handled in the Istio custom resource.
  The field is now unset by default, while the effective behavior remains the same as before (`SANITIZE_SET`).
  See [#1769](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1769).

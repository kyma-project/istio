## Istio Updated to Version 1.27.0

We've updated the Istio version to 1.27.0 ([#1578](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1578)).
To learn about new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes in this release, read the [Istio 1.27.0 release announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.27.x/announcing-1.27/) and [Upgrade Notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.27.x/announcing-1.27/upgrade-notes/).

> [!Warning]
> Since version 1.27.0, Istio injects the Istio proxy as an initContainer by default. In this release, the Istio module's operator disables this behavior to maintain compatibility. Disabling this behavior is a temporary measure and will be removed with the Istio module 1.22. After this, sidecar proxies will be injected as initContainers by default.

## New Features

- The Istio module now supports installation with Istio images injected into the installer from environment variables. This allows for more flexible deployments, especially in environments where images are not available in a public registry. See [issue #1519](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1519).

## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed a bug where the `proxy-protocol` EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the `Warning` state. See [#1491](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1491).
- We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled. See [#1523](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1523).
- We've fixed a bug where the `app.kubernetes.io/version` label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources. See [#1523](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1523).
- We've fixed a bug where Istio sidecar injected as initContainer was not removed during Istio uninstallation. See [#1555](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1555).

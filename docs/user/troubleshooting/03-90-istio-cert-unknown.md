# Istio cannot verify HTTPS certificate generated by a trusted signing CA

## Possible symptoms

- Istiod logs include multiple warnings/errors that include `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`.
- A set up JWT authorization flow does not work, and requests with valid tokens end up with a 401 Status error `Jwt verification fails`.
- Istio sidecars Envoy configuration for JWT is not up-to-date.
- Checking server certificate chain reveals different Root CAs then for working servers.

## Cause

By default Istio requires that in case an outbound connection to a HTTPS server is initiated, the server certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, which means that at least the Root CA certificate presented by the server must be recognized by the client.
If, for some reason the server uses an urecognized Root CA to generate it's domain certificate (e.g. the server uses internal solution specific Root CA or it migrated to a fairly new, not widely recognized Root CA), the HTTPS handshake will fail, and the connection will not be established.
This might, for example, cause the JWKS fetch from the JWKS URI to fail.

## Remedy

To ensure that the certificate is trusted by Istio, make sure that you are using the most up-to-date version of the Istio module. If you are on BTP Kyma Runtime this is guaranteed by the solution.

In case your Istio module version is up-to-date, but the verification is still failing, make sure that the CA root cert is trusted by istiod.

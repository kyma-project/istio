## Fixed bugs

- We've fixed a bug that caused restarts during each reconciliation of an 
Istio-injected Pod with custom proxy resource settings defined using annotations.
See [#1649](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1649).

- We've fixed a bug where the `IstioVersion` annotation was not updated in the Istio CR when reconciliation failed to reach the last step, which could lead to blocked Istio upgrades. See [#1644](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1644).

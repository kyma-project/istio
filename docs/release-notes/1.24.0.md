## New Features

- Istio controller image is now running in FIPS140 compliancy mode, which is controlled by the `fips140=only,tlsmlkem=0` GODEBUG flags.
  We simplified the Istio installation, so it doesn't use port forwarding to get the Istio version.
  It also doesn't print the message about the Istio downgrade.
  See [#1672](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1672).
- We've added dual-stack experimental support.
  See [#1700](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1700).
